### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ananya

## About Me
I'm a former educator and researcher with a PhD in Philosophy. In my previous life, I taught courses on tech ethics and video games while researching the value of data in scientific communities. These days, I've channeled my love of spreadsheets into data science.
