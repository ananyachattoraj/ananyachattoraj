### Hi there! 👋 I'm Ananya, a Data Enthusiast 📊🚀

#### About Me
I'm a former educator and researcher with a PhD in Philosophy. In my previous life, I taught courses on tech ethics and video games while researching the value of data in scientific communities. These days, I've channeled my love of spreadsheets into data science. My current major interests are computer vision and NLP, but I've never met a CSV I haven't loved.

I believe in looking at a problem from all levels, big and small. My data-driven solutions always keep the social values and contexts of data in mind. The world goes beyond a ".fit" and so should our data practices.

#### Projects
- 🔍 Image Captioning: Creating a model with the Flickr8K dataset (hosted on Kaggle) & EfficientnetV2S to generate single sentence captions from input images. Modeling in progress.
- 🧶 Knitting Stitch Classifier: Building a model to classify knitting stitches using web-scraped images. Data collection underway.

#### Toolbox
- 🐍 Python, R
- 🤖 Keras, NLTK, Sci-kit Learn
- 📊 Excel, Numpy, Pandas
- 📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
- 💾 MySQL
