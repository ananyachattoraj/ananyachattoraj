### Hi there! 👋 I'm Ananya, a Data Enthusiast 📊🚀

#### About Me
I'm a former educator and researcher with a PhD in Philosophy. In my previous life, I taught courses on tech ethics and video games while researching the value of data in scientific communities. These days, I've channeled my love of spreadsheets into data science. My current major interests are computer vision and NLP, but I've never met a CSV I haven't loved. I'm now excited to utilize my analytics problem solving and technical skills in an analyst or machine learning position.

I believe in looking at a problem from all levels, big and small. My data-driven solutions always keep the social values and contexts of data in mind. The world goes beyond a ".fit" and so should our data practices. Let's build a data science community that works for humans.

#### Projects
- 🔍 [Image Captioning](https://github.com/ananyachattoraj/capstone): Creating a model with the Flickr8K dataset (hosted on Kaggle) & EfficientnetV2S to generate single sentence captions from input images. Demo video complete; further iterations on hiatus.
- 🧶 [Knitting Stitch Classifier](https://github.com/ananyachattoraj/stitch_classifier): Building a model to classify knitting stitches using web-scraped images. Modeling underway.
- 🏋️‍♀️ [International Powerlifting Federation Analysis](https://github.com/ananyachattoraj/ipf_next_lift): Cleaning and analyzing data from the International Powerlifting Federation from its inception to Aug 2023. Eventual goal is to create a predictive model that can help a user select their next squat/bench/deadlift attempt given competition sex, weight, and previous max. Cleaning underway
