### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ananya

## About Me
I'm a former educator and researcher with a PhD in Philosophy. In my previous life, I taught courses on tech ethics and video games while researching the value of data in scientific communities. These days, I've channeled my love of spreadsheets into data science. My current major interests are computer vision and NLP, but I've never met a CSV I haven't loved.

I believe in looking at a problem from all levels, big and small. My data-driven solutions always keep the social values and contexts of data in mind. The world goes beyond a ".fit" and so should our data practices.

## Projects
I'm actively working on two main projects:
- Image Captioning: Using the Flickr8K dataset (hosted on Kaggle) and transfer learning via EfficientnetV2S, I am creating a model to generate a single sentence caption given an image input. Currently in the modeling process.
- Knitting Stitch Classifier: Using web scraped images of knitting stitches, I am creating a model to classify new, unknown, images of knitting for stitch identification. Currently in the data collection process.

## Toolbox
- Programming Languages: Python, R
- Machine Learning: Keras, NLTK, Sci-kit Learn
- Data Analysis: Excel, Numpy, Pandas
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Excel
- Databases: MySQL

## Let's Connect
I'm always interested in connecting with other socially-driven data enthusiasts! Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ananya-chattoraj/) or via [email](mailto:cananya53@gmail.com) for a chat.
